## Go coding exercises

Good Luck ❤️❤️❤️

### How to solve

 - Each folder has a README.md file and `*_test.go` file, check it and find what kind of function you need to implement.
 - You may use anything you want except 3rd-party packages.
 - Implement the function.
 - Run tests.

### Run tests

Run it in the challenge folder:

```
go test .
```
