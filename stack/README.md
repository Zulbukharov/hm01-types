### Stack

A [`stack`](https://yourbasic.org/golang/slices-explained/) is an ordered data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Stacks are most easily implemented in Golang using `slices`:

An element is pushed to the `stack` with the built-in append function.
The element is popped from the `stack` by slicing off the top element.

Please implement your own `stack`.
